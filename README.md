# Exploring the dependencies of the CZI mentions dataset

![zoomed_out](https://github.com/borisveytsman/SoftwareImpactHackathon2023_Tracing_dependencies/assets/1060/f0a6b5dc-d0b3-4642-9fee-7a389a380b73)


## Exploring the Dependencies of Mentioned Software in the CZI Software Mentions Dataset

![scatter plot of number of mentions on x-axis, Katz score on y-axis and colored by ecosystem](./notebooks/katz-mentions-ecosystem.png)

We construct a graph of dependencies between software packages mentioned in the CZI Software Mentions Dataset. We then use the Katz centrality score to rank the importance of each software package. The data is [available](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10048132) as `Brown, E. M. (2023). A Dependency Graph for 460,000 Papers and Their Software Mentions from the CZI Software Mentions Dataset (1.0.0) [Data set]. CZI Research Software Hackathon. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10048132`.

We find some interesting examples of "most important" (given that some of the ecosystems are incorrectly labelled):
* [PACE](https://forensiccoe.org/pace/) is the most mentioned software but may not be the most "critical" / connected
* [VELVET](https://bioinformaticshome.com/tools/wga/descriptions/Velvet.html#gsc.tab=0) is seemingly the "most critical" / connected software that has very few mentions
* [PERMANOVA](https://rdocumentation.org/packages/PERMANOVA/versions/0.2.0/topics/PERMANOVA) is seemingly a "true" (mentioned and identified in the correct ecosystem) which is incredidly important and correct and has a number of mentions.

### Software That is Important but has No Mentions in the Literature

All of these are NEVER mentioned.

PyPI - `six`: Python 2 and 3 compatibility utilities.

Bioconductor - `BiocIO`: a package for basic file handling and some formats

CRAN - `isoband`: An R package to generate contour lines and polygons.
